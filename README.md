# Java

This repository contains a three-stage Java application for managing competition data, demonstrating incremental development, SOLID principles and database integration.

## Part 1 – Competitor Class  
• Define a `Competitor` class with ID, name, level, extra attribute, getters/setters, `getOverallScore()`, `getFullDetails()` and `getShortDetails()` methods  

## Part 2 – Database Integration  
• Extend `Competitor` to store an array of scores, calculate overall score, and implement JDBC methods to read/write a MySQL `CompetitionDB.Competitors` table  

## Part 3 – Reporting and User Interaction  
• Implement `CompetitorList` and `Manager` classes to retrieve data, generate full and summary reports (top performer, frequency statistics), and support user-driven queries  

**Requirements**  
Java 11+, JDBC, MySQL, JUnit (for testing), UML class diagrams, Javadoc and a 3-minute demonstration video.
